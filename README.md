# SecretNotes
This is a simple Python application called "Secret Notes" that allows you to store and encrypt your secret notes using a master key. 
The application uses the tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI) and the cryptography library to perform encryption and decryption.

# Usage
1) Launch the application by running the script.
2) You'll see a window with options to enter your note's title, the secret message, and a master key for encryption.
3) Enter the required information and click the "Save & Encrypt" button to save and encrypt your note.
4) To decrypt a previously encrypted note, enter the encrypted message and the master key, then click the "Decrypt" button.
